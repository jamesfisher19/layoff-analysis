# Layoff Data Analysis (2020-2023)

This project analyzes **global tech layoffs from 2020 to 2023**, focusing on **layoff trends, industry impact, and company performance**.

Through **SQL queries and data visualization**, this project provides a comprehensive look at layoffs in tech and related industries, highlighting trends such as:
- The **industries most affected** by layoffs.
- The **companies with the highest layoffs per year**.
- The **impact of funding on company layoffs**.
- **Rolling monthly layoff trends** over time.
- The **countries that experienced the most layoffs**.
